~~~ Task ~~~

Write a JavaScript program to display the status (i.e. display book name, author name and reading status) of books.
You are given an object library in the code's template. It contains a list of books with the above mentioned properties.
Your task is to display the following:

- If the book is unread:

  You still need to read '<book_name>' by <author_name>.

- If the book is read:

  Already read '<book_name>' by <author_name>.

function displayInformation() {
     // var library is defined, use it to print the information
} 

// tail starts here
var library = [ 
    {
        title: 'Bill Gates',
        author: 'The Road Ahead',
        readingStatus: true
    },
    {
        title: 'Steve Jobs',
        author: 'Walter Isaacson',
