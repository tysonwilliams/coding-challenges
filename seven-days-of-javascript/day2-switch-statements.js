You are given a variable, num. Your task is to print: 

- ONE, if num is equal to 1. 
- TWO, if num is equal to 2. 
- THREE, if num is equal to 3.
- FOUR, if num is equal to 4.
- FIVE, if num is equal to 5.
- SIX, if num is equal to 6.
- SEVEN, if num is equal to 7.
- EIGHT, if num is equal to 8.
- NINE, if num is equal to 9.
- PLEASE TRY AGAIN, if num is none of the above.

~~~ Note ~~~

Do not declare the variable num; it is declared inside our code checker. Use console.log to print statements to the console.
